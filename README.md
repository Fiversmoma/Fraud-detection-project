# Fraud-detection-project

This project implements machine learning models for detecting fraud in financial transactions. The models used are Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. The performance of the models is evaluated based on the training and testing accuracy.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle - Fraud Detection Dataset. The target variable is whether the transaction is fraudulent or not.

Prerequisites

    Python 3.x
    Jupyter Notebook
    
  Results

The following table shows the training and testing accuracy of each model:

Model	                            Training Accuracy (%)	            Testing Accuracy (%)
Logistic Regression                     	96.69	                            96.64
Decision Tree Classifier	                100.00	                            99.86
Random Forest Classifier	                99.99	                            99.99
Conclusion

The results show that all three models perform well in detecting fraud in financial transactions. However, the Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier models have higher accuracy than the Logistic Regression model But Random Classifier model was adopted. Further analysis can be done to determine the most suitable model for the dataset.
